# PostGrad-System
My university has a postgrad office responsible for masters and PhD. programs. The postgrad office wants to create a system to keep track of students doing their postgrad studies as well as manage the process of students taking prerequisite courses for the postgrad studies. Students need to register for their master or PhD through this system. The aim of the project is to implement a system that provides these features to the parties involved.
